                    <p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Irfan Alam </p>
                    <p><strong>Date:</strong> October 17, 2024</p>
                    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> 
		I wrote a long preprint titled "Generalizing the de Finetti--Hewitt--Savage Theorem" (arXiv:2008.08754v4) in 2020 (last updated in 2023), which used methods from nonstandard analysis to vastly generalize de Finetti's theorem from probability theory. Based on recommendations from the peer-review of this preprint, I recently had to create an updated shorter version consisting of the mathematical core of this work, titled "On the de Finetti--Hewitt--Savage Theorem" (accessible at this link). I am aiming to talk about this work in an accessible manner. In particular, I plan to spend almost equal amounts of time on the following topics:

                    <h3> Towards Linear Topoi </h3>  
                    <p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Riley Shahar </p>
                    <p><strong>Date:</strong> September 27, 2024</p>
                    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Topos theory plays a central role in geometry and categorical logic. For instance, topoi yield a natural semantic theory of intuitionistic dependent type theories. One important step in this theory is the observation that topoi are Heyting categories, i.e. that propositions in the internal logic of a topos can be refined along intuitionistjc predicates. In this talk, I will attempt to give an accessible outline of this classical story and motivate the study of "linear topoi", categories which exhibit topos-like behavior with respect to a linear internal logic. I will conclude with a discussion of some progress towards an axiomatic presentation of these categories. </p>

                    <h3> Completeness of GŁ∀ </h3>  
                    <p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Jin Wei </p>
                    <p><strong>Date:</strong> September 20, 2024</p>
                    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In this talk, I will share my most recent result on the completeness of hypersequent calculus for first-order Łukasiewicz logic. I will first provide necessary backgrounds and motivations, especially its connection to continuous model theory, and explain the story of earlier incomplete (picking my word carefully) attempts by others. Then I will present my proof in details. I will also point out three potential future research directions and share why I believe they are very exciting.

                    <h3>Induction and coInduction formalized</h3>
                    <p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Oualid Merzouga </p>
                    <p><strong>Date:</strong> September 09, 2024</p>
                    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong>  Induction is a widely recognized proof technique in mathematics. From your five-years old past friend asking, “How do you know the numbers                         don’t stop?” to a thesis topic on “How to prove that Peano Arithmetic is consistent” this technique has become and continues to be one of the most trusted tools for                             mathematicians. 

                    </p> <br>
                    
                    <p> To investigate further this proof technique, we can formalize it within mathematics itself. We will employ category theory to find an appropriate formulation for what                             it means to prove something by induction.
                    </p> <br>
                    <p>
                    This natural process will lead us to define inductive data structures and their dual, co-inductive structures. We will begin by building intuition behind these concepts                         through standard examples and conclude by embedding these ideas within category theory, enabling you to confidently respond to your past five-year-old friends:
                    </p> <br>
                    <p> “Of course, numbers don’t stop; they are merely the manifestation of the initial algebra for a specific endofunctor!”</p>
