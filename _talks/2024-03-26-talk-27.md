Algorithmic information theory is an information theory on individual, finite objects. Starting from an effective notion of entropy or a priori probability, one may formalize notions of randomness, computational depth, stochasticity, and even statistics on individual objects. I plan to discuss a general approach to defining algorithmic entropy on a class of metric spaces, how this entropy relates to fractal geometry, as well as how algorithmic information theory — despite involving non-computable operations — still offers practical applications.
