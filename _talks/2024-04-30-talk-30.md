Have you ever questioned whether Modus Ponens is a valid rule of inference? While it may seem easy to add connectives or rules to a logical system, the true test lies in ensuring that they carry genuine meaning. Step into the realm of Proof-Theoretic Semantics. Forget about seeking reassurance in Model Theory, Linguistics, or programming languages; we will explore what it takes for a connective to be "self-justifying." We will delve into how the notion of harmony between introduction and elimination rules comes into play. By investigating the insights of Gentzen, Prawitz, Dummett, and Tennant, we will discover how your favorite logic is incoherent. If classical logic holds a special place in your heart and you prefer it to remain this way, the organizers recommend you steer clear of this talk!
