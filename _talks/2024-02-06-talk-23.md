In the _Critique of Pure Reason_, Immanuel Kant purposes two logic systems, general logic and transcendental logic. In this framework, Kant claims that his table of judgments is “complete and and entirely exhaust the entire field of pure understanding”; in contrast, modern logicians commonly consider his logics as “terrifyingly narrow-minded and mathematically trivial”. In this talk, I will briefly describe Kant’s logic systems and introduce a recent attempt to mathematically formalize them. We will realize Kant’s general logic as geometric logic, which is closely related to topos theory; and provide syntax (a sequent calculus) and semantics (inverse limit of a countable inverse system of ﬁnite models) for transcendental logic together with soundness and completeness results.
