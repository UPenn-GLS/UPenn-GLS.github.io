When Godel constructed L, the inner model of constructible set, he thought that V=L would make the set-theoretic world much nicer and simpler to understand. Unfortunately, there were too many limitation in L that Godel's belief was short-lived. As it turns out, L cannot even admit large cardinal hypothesis like measurable cardinal. The Ultimate-L program strives to extend L to include those large cardinals, and it seems like the end is in sight, with the discovery that supercompact cardinal is enough. In this talk, we will focus on several key ideas and questions that motivate the program.
