The continuum hypothesis was the first non-trivial problem in cardinal arithmetic. In short, the continuum hypothesis is the statement that if X is an uncountably infinite subset of the reals, then X has the same cardinality as the reals. While this statement was eventually shown to be independent of the standard axioms of set theory, there were many failed proof attempts. In this talk, we will chart the history of one such attempt, sometimes dubbed the "Perfect Set Program". Since perfect sets provably have the same cardinality as the continuum, it would suffice to show that every uncountable subset of reals contains a perfect subset. While this strategy was doomed to fail, mathematicians were able to prove that a surprisingly rich collection of uncountable sets necessarily contain perfect subsets. This talk will be accessible without a background in set theory of logic. Bring $5 because there will be an opportunity to gamble a littleâ€¦
