Since intuitionistic propositional logic (IPC) rejects law of the excluded middle, naturally there were some attempts to relate IPC to many-valued logics. Later Gödel shows that IPC is necessarily an infinitely-truth-valued logic by the means of intermediate logics. In this talk, I will introduce and present several proofs of his result, such as Heyting algebras, Kripke semantics, and cut elimination. On the second part, I will introduce the notion of provability in IPC and show its equivalence to Eben’s favorite modal logic system S_4. My favorite is S_5 and thanks for asking : )
