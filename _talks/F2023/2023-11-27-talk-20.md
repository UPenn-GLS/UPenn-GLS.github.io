The Effective Topos is an important model of constructive higher order logic as it is the first example an an elementary topos that internally is constructive and is not a Grothendieck topos; in fact it doesn't even have countable limits and colimits. The Effective Topos is built out of the theory of partial recursive functions. As such, it is a model a recursive mathematics. However, the Effective Topos has some peculiar properties. In this talk I will briefly talk about the construction of the Effective Topos and a few interesting facts about it.
