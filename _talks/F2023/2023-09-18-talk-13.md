We'll start by considering a graph on the natural numbers first constructed by Ackermann in the 1930s. Then we'll look at a continuum sized set of randomly generated graphs. Surprisingly all of these graphs will be isomorphic to one another and to Ackermann's graph. Using some model theory, we'll show that most large finite graphs behave the same way and that this behavior is governed by the behavior of the Random Graph. Finally we'll cover some surprising similarities between the Random Graph and the rational numbers.
