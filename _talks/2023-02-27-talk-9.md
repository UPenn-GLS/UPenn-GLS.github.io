A topos arises as the category of sheaves on a Grothendieck site (by definition). But what exactly is a Grothendieck site? Every source appears to give a slight variation on the definition. For instance, some authors speak of covering families while others restrict to covering sieves. Often certain singleton sets are taken as coverings, but is it the identities, isomorphisms, or split epis? Must a Grothendieck site have fibre products (or else how would you formulate the sheaf condition)? I will explain why none of the answers to these questions make a difference insofar as what categories arise as sheaves on a site, or in other words, why the notion of topos is independent of the exact definition of Grothendieck topology. This phenomenon is in part what lead Johnstone to the namesake of his topos theory compendium, writing “however you approach [the elephant], it is still the same animal.”
