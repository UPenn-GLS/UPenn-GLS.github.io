Many different propositional logics (fundamentally) operate on the same set of connectives, from classical propositional logic to nonassociative Lambek calculus with additives to intuitionistic linear logic.  Since there are finitely many connectives, there are finitely many formulas of a given size, up to renaming the propositional variables.  Thus, for any size, each logic proves some finite number of these formulas.  We use this notion of 'quantitative strength' of propositional logics to get a deeper handle on the relative strength of substructural logics.  This talk is not mainly a substructural logic talk.  After setting up the problem, the focus will be on using the programming language Maude as a tool to quickly check provability in bespoke logics in proof theory generally.  We'll end by briefly discussing open questions in the area.
