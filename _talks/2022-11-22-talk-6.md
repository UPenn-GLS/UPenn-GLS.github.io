While linear logic can fairly be described as a logic of resources, it also forms a "computational core" of logic.  This talk will serve mainly as a paced introduction to the fundamentals of linear logic, seeking to motivate each (intuitionistic) connective via both the resource interpretation and lattices.  Based on time and interest we will see connections to modal logic & positive and negative data types & calling conventions & 1.
