The interactive theorem prover Lean has drawn huge attention among mathematicians over the past few years. The idea is to write math proofs in this software and it will verify proofs for you. But can we really trust Lean? How exactly does Lean work? I will introduce Lean and then talk about the internal logic system of Lean in a series of two talks. In this first talk, I will demonstrate how to do math in Lean. In particular, we will explore the ring theory section in Mathlib, make sense of some basic definitions(some of them look weird at first glance), and prove some easy theorems in Lean together! We will also make use of some recent tools available to Lean, such as chatGPT and Paperproof. No prerequisite is needed and all who are curious are welcome! (You can just lay back and enjoy watching me with zero background in programming awkwardly show you things in VSCode).
