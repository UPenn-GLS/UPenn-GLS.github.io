In this second part, I will focus on type theory, the internal logic, of Lean. I will first present its axiomatization based on dependent type theory and talk about its three principal axioms: propext, choice, and quotient. We will prove that Lean is as consistent as ZFC plus existence of infinitely many large cardinals by using Grothendieck universes. Theoretically, if the kernel of Lean ever returns a false judgement, then we should be able to extract a direct proof of inconsistency of ZFC + infinitely large cardinals (this extraction has to be based on weak system, such as PRA, if you remember from my pizza talk : ). Afterwards, we will talk about proof irrelevance, the one axiom before all axioms, and show some of its interesting consequences in Lean, such as undecidability of definitional equality and incompatibility with homotopy type theory (sorry to Oualid). This talk is mainly based on Mario Carneiroâ€™s excellent paper, the Type Theory of Lean.
