In his renowned 1900 ICM address, Hilbert presented a set of problems, among which the 10th problem sought an algorithm to determine if a given polynomial over Z, with any number of variables, has a root in Z. This was eventually proven impossible by showing that, in some sense, polynomials over Z are a rudimentary programming language. More precisely, the Davis-Putnam-Robinson-Matiyasevich (DPRM) theorem establishes a bijective correspondence between computably-enumerable sets and sets of polynomial roots over Z. In this talk, I will briefly overview the long history to this conclusion, sketch some parts of the proof of DPRM, and say a few words about current research on variants of Hilbert's 10th problem.
