Bounded arithmetic extends Peano arithmetic with new function symbols and then restricts the use of quantifiers.  This is arguably a natural logical description of the polynomial-time complexity class.  We prove that a straightforward hierarchy of formula classes corresponds formally to the familiar polynomial hierarchy.  Along the way, we make pedagogically-motivated stops at several computational formalisms and logics.  Many of these formalisms are weakly equivalent, and we focus here on the equivalences near P and NP.
