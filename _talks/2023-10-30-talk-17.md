Identity, a foundational concept in mathematics, is perceived through diverse lenses across various fields. This talk delves into the intricate realm of this relation, focusing on a type-theoretic approach. 

Specifically, we will axiomatize equality and shed light on the enigmatic concept of "path induction". 

The pursuit of axiomatizing equality, though noble, reveals itself as a formidable challenge, if not an impossible endeavor. At its core, this predicament emerges from the existence of two distinct yet non-equivalent notions of equality. It's akin to the surprise of expecting one child but giving birth to twinsâ€”loved equally, yet undeniably distinct.


With a critical lens, we strive to rectify this perplexing issue and propose a refined definition that harmonizes these dual conceptions.
