Starting with familiar sequent systems, like classical propositional logic, we motivate a system where irreversible proof steps are postponed as long as possible.  We’ll discuss connectives from several logics, classifying them based on the reversibility of their left/right rules.  This classification, plus some notational bureaucracy, allows us to “focus” the proof system, naturally limiting the application of irreversible rules, vastly speeding up naive proof search.  Notably, this new system is not always complete with respect to the old, though completeness is very desirable.  Time permitting, we end with a survey of academic and industrial applications of focussed proof systems.
