A metric can be viewed as a strengthened equality: not only does it decide whether two elements are equal but also quantitatively measures the failure of an equality. Replacing equality in a structure with a metric has nice results, for instance, Hilbert spaces are not axiomatizable in regular logic but will be under this change. Doing so will require a logic that permits continuum many truth values. In this talk, I will define continuous logic for metric structures, discuss its semantic and syntactic properties, and show soundness and completeness for a Hilbert-style proof system of this logic. This talk is primarily based on works of Ita√Ø Ben Yaacov and others.

We will meet in DRL in the math lounge at 2 PM.
