As defined by Pop, a field k is large if every smooth k-variety either has 0 k-rational points or infinitely many. The main goal of this talk is to illustrate an application of saturation in the setting of large fields. We will remove a pesky technical condition from a result of Pop, so that if a variety has infinitely many k-rational points, then most of the rational points do not come from a (finite) collection of subfields. The main technical inputs will be highly saturated ultrapowers and an old group-theoretic lemma of Neumann. Some knowledge of algebraic geometry at the level of affine varieties will be assumed.
