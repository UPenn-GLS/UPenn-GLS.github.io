In this second part, we will investigate the foundation of Lean, namely Calculus of Constructions (CoC) plus inductive types and proof irrelevance. I will present axioms and rules of CoC, which are surprisingly very few, and see how everything is constructed in a very elegant way. We will talk about impredicativity of the Proposition universe and see how this distinguishes CoC from the usual Martin-LÃ¶f type theory and why it leads to proof irrelevance in a very natural way. Meanwhile, we will illustrate these features with some concrete examples in Lean. After the introduction, we will construct a proof-irrelevance model of CoC in ZFC with a large cardinal axiom. This will prove that Lean is as consistent as ZFC plus existence of infinitely many large cardinals, modulo the obvious assumption that the actual implementation of Lean in computers is bug-free. If we have time, we will also talk about various consequences of proof irrelevance in Lean, such as undecidability of definitional equality and incompatibility with Homotopy Type Theory (sorry to Oualid). The goal of this talk is to convey why I think CoC is an awesome foundation of mathematics on its own, regardless of the success of Coq and Lean as proof assistants.
