In this talk, I will give a _very basic_ introduction to the topological semantics of intuitionistic propositional logic, and focus on some concrete examples to hopefully clarify the definitions. I'll briefly sketch the soundness and completeness of this semantics. While some knowledge of point-set topology is assumed, no prior understanding of formal logic is required to follow the talk.
