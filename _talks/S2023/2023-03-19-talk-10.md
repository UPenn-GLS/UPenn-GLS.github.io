In recent years, o-minimality has been successfully applied to a number of problems in diophantine geometry via the so-called Pila-Zannier strategy.
The aim of this talk is to introduce this ingenious method by sketching the Pila-Zannier strategy proof of the multiplicative Manin-Mumford conjecture, which will be stated during the talk. In the process, we will introduce the Pila-Wilkie counting theorem, which informally states that "transcendental" sets have relatively few rational points. Prerequisites: The very basics of classical algebraic geometry and Galois theory, and enough familiarity with model theory to know what a definable set is. I will briefly review the necessary ideas from o-minimality near the beginning of the talk; hence, while previous experience with o-minimality might be helpful, those who did not attend the previous seminar talk on o-minimality should still be able to follow this talk.
