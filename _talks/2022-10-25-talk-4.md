Metric can be viewed as a strengthened equality: not only does it decide whether two elements are equal but also quantitatively measures the failure of an equality. Reversely, we can view equality as just a discrete metric and study structures with built-in metric as their equality predicate (Hilbert spaces for instance). Doing so will require a logic that permits continuum many truth values. In this talk, I will define continuous logic for metric structures, discuss its semantical and syntactical properties, and show soundness and completeness for a Hilbert-style proof system of this logic. This talk is primarily based on works of Ita√Ø Ben Yaacov and others.
