I once gave a proof theory talk to a set-theory-focused logic group. A student, who clearly did not read my abstract, asked which forcing notion I am gonna use, which left me speechless. However, now I am actually able to answer such questions by talking about proof-theoretic forcing. In particular, we will investigate a forcing proof of cut elimination and compare it with the standard syntactic (better) proof and algebraic proof. If we have time, we will also talk about many applications of forcing on conservativity results in proof theory. This talk is mainly based on Jeremy Avigadâ€™s works.
