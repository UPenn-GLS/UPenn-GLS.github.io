I once gave a proof theory talk to a set-theory-focused logic group. A person who clearly did not read my abstract asked which forcing notion I am gonna use and it left me speechless. Finally, I am now ready to face such challenges by talking about proof-theoretic forcing. In particular, we will investigate a forcing proof of cut elimination, inspired from the nonconstructive algebraic proof, and extract an explicit algorithm of cut elimination using Martin-Löf type theory and realizability. This can be viewed as a simple proof mining procedure on the algebraic proof of cut elimination. If we have time, we will also talk about some conservativity results in proof theory related to forcing. This talk is mainly based on Jeremy Avigad’s works.
