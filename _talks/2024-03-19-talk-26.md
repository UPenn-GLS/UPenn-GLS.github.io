It is well-known that field theory is a ripe area for model theory and algebra to interact in interesting and non-trivial ways. The class of large fields has been of recent interest: I will survey some recent results about large fields, but I will not discuss proofs. Instead, I will sketch a proof of a precursor to those results due to MacIntyre about categorical theories of fields. If time permits, I will illustrate another way that model theory and algebra interact through a new result on diophantine subsets of large fields.
