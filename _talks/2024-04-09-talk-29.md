Continuing the previous continuous logic talk, I will explain the syntax part of continuous logic, particularly focusing on Lukasiewicz logic. I will introduce Hilbert-style and Gentzen-style proof systems for both propositional and first-order Lukasiewicz logic and sketch completeness results and my own proof of cut elimination. Afterwards, I will talk about the current status of my research and particular problems that I am working on in this project: constructive information of the approximate Hebrandâ€™s theorem and completeness of the hypersequent calculus.
